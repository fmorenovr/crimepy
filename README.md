## Concepts

* Weaponization -> 
* Exploitation -> 

### Goals

* Threads -- set of posts under the same header (same subject)  
* Classify Threads (Posts) -- weaponization vs exploitation vs others  
* Understand the role of different players (authors) -- can you also rank and/or classify authors? are there authors that tend to behave in one way, and others that behave in other ways?

* How people talk and refer to other communities?  
* How comments vary across communities?  
* Keyword matching would be a way to quantify such sentiments?  
* Sentiment analysis?  
* Community driven vs player driven effort to identify scams?  
* Who is diminishing/building reputation across communities?  
* Before machine learning classifier, it would be better to understand how trust is divided into users and communities --- do communities talk about each other?  Do users talk about each other?   Semantic topic  

* General goal: collect insights about vulnerability lifecycle from black-hat forums
* Specific goal 1: show exploratory analysis of how vulnerabilities appear in CrimeBB (show plots, tables, comments, etc)  
* Specific goal 2: propose and validate a method to automatically tag and/or classify threads or posts  
* Specific goal 3: answer questions about reputation and social network involving authors
