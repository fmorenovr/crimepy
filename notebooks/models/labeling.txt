To analyse the discussions of vulnerabilities in Hackforums, we filter from the dataset what we call special threads. 
These threads contain 1 or more posts citing vulnerabilities. By reading the discussions of each of these threads,
 we classify them according to their danger level. We define the following 3 classes in ascending order of threat level:

1) PoC:  
      The proof of concept class represents the threads that refer to vulnerabilities in a non-threatful way.
      In general, discussions that don't show signs of future exploitation, or talks about exploiting in a controlled environment,
       are considered to be PoC. Thus, this class represents the less dangerous threads.

       keywords:
      - has word trillium
      - has word PoC or poc,etc
      - tutorial
      - penetration test
      - guide

2) Weaponization:
      Weaponization label is assigned to threads that show promising discussions for exploiting a vulnerability. Thus,
      the weaponization class represents discussions that can lead to an exploitation but are not there yet. 
      In some weaponization threads, the users are very close to succeed in hacking, but something in the code doesn't work,
       so they share their code asking for help. In others, users initiate threads offering money for exploits
        for specific vulnerabilities, but the messages exchanged doesn't indicate that the exploits were bought or were functional. 
        Colloquially, we can think of this class as the "almost there" threads.

      keywords: 
      - fud*
      - money, price, bitcoin
      - sell, trade
      - buy
      - packs
      - metasploit
      - sharing of code of someone trying to hack

      Fud kits or exploits are considered to be weaponization

3) Exploitation: 
      While in weaponization threads there is no conclusion of exploits being used, exploitation threads are assertive regarding 
      the exploitation available in the wild for cited vulnerabilities. In these threads we see confirmed trades and exploitations
      by Hackforums' members. We envision that our model will have a higher precision for classification of threads of this class.
      - Sell confirmed or buy confirmed


4) Help: - 'need help', 'trying to', etc

5) Others

To clarify: 
    - is 'code' a keyword too?
    - If someone is citing an exploit from ExploitDB or NVD just showing vulnerabilities of some system, can we say it is a PoC?
    - how to treat the help threads?
